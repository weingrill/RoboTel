Hydraulics System
=================

The hydraulics system is required for the azimuth bearing and the brakes on
the azimuth and the elevation axis. To start the hydraulics system:
* Turn the power switch on the main panel to "ON"
* Press the "START" button on the main panel.

To stop the hydraulics system:
* Press the "STOP" button on the main panel.
* Press the emergency stop. (see :doc:`safety`)

When stopping the hydraulics system in normal operation the suction pump might
continue pumping to ensure that the upper reservoir is empty.
The main pump and the suction pump are both equipped with a soft start and
soft stop electronics. This takes several seconds until the pumps have full
power.
The brakes can only be opened if enough pressure has been built up.
If a main phase is missing, the pumps will not start. In this case an error
condition is shown.
If the main pump is started and the pressure is not ok within ten seconds, an
error will be raised.

In case of an error the hydraulics system will be shut down.
If the oil temperature is below 10℃ or above 50℃, a warning will be issued.
