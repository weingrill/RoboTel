Introduction
------------
RoboTel was build by Halfmann and upgraded by AIP in 2020/2021. All important
electronic components have been replaced by Beckhoff modules.
A central Beckhoff PLC controls the servo controllers, DC controllers,
temperature sensors and digital I/Os.

Please read the :doc:`safety` before operating the telescope.
