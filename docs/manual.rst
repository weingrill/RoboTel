Manual Operation
================

The telescope can be operated manually for commissioning, testing or
observation. To enable manual operation:
* Turn the power switch on the main panel to "ON".
* Press "START" to start the hydraulic system.
* Turn the brake clearance to "ON".
* On the pendant control turn the manual key switch to "ON".

The manual operation overrides any remote command.

The selector switch (1-15) enables the individual components on the telescope.
It is advised to leave the manual switch in "OFF" position, while turning the selector.
Moving the selector fast in manual operation may cause drive errors.
If not otherwise noted, these general rules apply for all selections:
* "ENABLE" enables the drive.
* "RESET" disables the drive or resets the error.
* Buttons that can be pressed are illuminated.
* When a limit switch is reached, the respective button is disabled.
